# VOLUME CONFIGURATION:
# - If deploying from Railway Template: Volume is auto-created ✅
# - If deploying from GitHub directly: Add volume manually (see DEPLOY_TO_RAILWAY.md)

# Railway does not support volume definitions in railway.toml.
#

# 1. Go to your service → Settings → Volumes
# 2. Click "New Volume"
# 3. Mount Path: /data
# 4. Size: 1GB (minimum)
